Boston Scientific (BSX) said in its recent annual filing that it ended 2016 with ""approximately 27,000 employees,"" and that 14,000 of those were outside the U.S. That’s up from the 25,000 global headcount it reported a year earlier, when it reported that 12,000 of its employees were out of the country — implying that its U.S. headcount remained constant in 2016.  A spokesperson for the company clarified on Monday that the company had in fact added ""several hundred"" employees in the U.S. during 2016, but that the increase wasn't reflected in the recent filing due to rounding off the numbers."
