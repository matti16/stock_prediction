LOUIS, Dec. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Centene Corporation (CNC) announced today its 2017 financial guidance. Total revenue is expected to be $46.0 billion to $46.8 billion, representing growth of approximately 17% compared to the midpoint of the 2016 guidance range. Earnings per diluted share are expected to be $3.78 to $4.22, representing an increase of 44% compared to the 2016 guidance range of $2.73 to $2.83. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be $4.40 to $4.85. The Company's 2017 guidance reflects lower margins on the Health Insurance Marketplace business as a result of the uncertainty created by the outcome of the presidential election. This additional conservatism in the Marketplace margins reduced the Company's GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.20 per diluted share for 2017. If the Health Insurance Marketplace business performance is consistent with 2016, the Company's earnings are expected to be at the high end of the guidance range."
