(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who are candidates for systemic therapy. The investigational biologic therapy Dupixent inhibits signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, two key cytokines required for the type 2 (including Th2) immune response, which is believed to be a major driver in the pathogenesis of the disease. The objective of the studies was to evaluate Dupixent as monotherapy (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2) and in concomitant administration with topical corticosteroids (CHRONOS) in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies."

""While it's great to see that so many men want to take charge of their health, these survey results reinforce that health services can still do a better job of engaging with men to make this happen. Whether it's online or via pharmacies or GPs, designing services to meet men's needs better means men will get help and advice earlier - and that can only be a good thing,"" said Martin Tod, Chief Executive of the Men's Health Forum (MHF)."

Regeneron and Sanofi recently asked U.S. regulators to approve the injectable medicine, Dupixent (dupilumab), after it significantly cleared skin lesions in the same pair of studies without serious side effects typically seen with standard treatments for the chronic inflammatory skin disease. ""Reduction of itch intensity is important because itching is one of the most burdensome symptoms for patients and can impact other aspects of their lives, such as sleep,"" said Dr. Eric Simpson, a dermatologist at Oregon Health & Science University who led the trials."

In addition, both trials met key secondary endpoints measuring reduction in itch, improvement in patient-reported anxiety and depression symptoms, and certain quality of life measures. Dupixent inhibits signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, two key cytokines required for the type 2 (including Th2) immune response, which is believed to be a major driver in AD, and certain atopic or allergic diseases including asthma and nasal polyposis, where Dupixent is being evaluated in ongoing clinical studies."
