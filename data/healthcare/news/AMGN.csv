This demonstrates a significant unmet need, as event rates in the real world are typically two to three times higher than those seen in clinical trial settings,"" said Sean E.

Harper, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. Often occurring in patients in Stage 5 of CKD,1,2 secondary HPT refers to the excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands in response to decreased renal function and impaired mineral metabolism.1,3 Parsabiv binds to and activates the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid gland, thereby causing decreases in PTH."

Biologics, manufactured in living cells, then extracted and purified, are more complex than traditional medicines and cannot be copied with precision, and so their knock-off versions are called biosimilars instead of generics. The allure of biosimilars is clear, with insurers and other payers counting on the steep discounts."

More than 66 percent of Cosentyx patients achieved ""clear or almost clear"" skin after four years, Novartis said, comparable with the 68.5 percent who hit that milestone after one year. A durable response is important, since older biotech drugs for plaque psoriasis, known as anti-TNFs, can lose their effectiveness over time."
