Neogen's new Reveal Q+ MAX tests for deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisin, zearalenone and T-2/HT-2 toxin join the previously available Reveal Q+ MAX tests for aflatoxin and ochratoxin. The line eliminates the need for labs to handle and dispose of harsh chemical solvents, and provides fully quantitative results using a test strip that you simply dip into the extracted sample — it doesn't get any easier,"" said Ed Bradley, Neogen's vice president of Food Safety."
