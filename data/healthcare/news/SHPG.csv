Initial findings from the GABR research presented at EAHAD show the incidence of hemophilia may be more than three times current global estimates and a bleeding episode occurs every three to 15 seconds worldwide.[1] This finding builds on existing data showing only 25 percent of people living with hemophilia receive adequate treatment.[2] The comprehensive findings from the model, which will be published in 2017, aim to help highlight the significant unmet needs that remain while expanding and improving strategies for hemophilia care around the world."
