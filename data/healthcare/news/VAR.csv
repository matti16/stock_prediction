Used with a Varian TrueBeam® medical linear accelerator to treat a prostate cancer patient on January 10th, the Calypso system detects even slight movements of a tumor so it can be targeted accurately with the treatment beam. The Calypso beacon system works by implanting transponders approximately the size of a grain of rice into the tumor so that the tumor location can be tracked from outside the patient. The transponders emit non-ionizing electromagnetic signals that are tracked in real-time and used to keep a treatment beam on target."
