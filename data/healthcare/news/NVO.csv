Often, the media use images to accompany news stories that depict people living with obesity from unflattering angles, focusing on the abdomen or lower body with the head cut out of the frame, and frequently consuming unhealthy food or engaged in sedentary activity.1 Widespread use of these stereotypical ""fat-shaming"" images can promote weight bias and discrimination, a significant cause of distress in people living with obesity.
