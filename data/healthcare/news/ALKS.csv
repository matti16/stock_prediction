Overall, we believe sentiment on the group remains relatively robust with noise on the drug pricing side far below what it has been and investors still cautiously optimistic on the possibility of corporate tax reform coming through in 2018.  Depending on how these issues play out, it could also lead to increased excitement around potential business development and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the sector, as we believe most of our large cap companies are still waiting for further clarity on these issues before announcing transformative deals."
