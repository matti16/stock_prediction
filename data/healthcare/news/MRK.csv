Merck said it had not decided whether to seek regulatory  approval in the United States and elsewhere for anacetrapib -  part of a class known as CETP inhibitors designed to raise HDL,  the so-called good cholesterol.  The company, which announced in June that the trial had met  its main goal, also repeated previous findings that prolonged  use led to build up of the drug in fat tissue."
