Sofosbuvir, sold by the U.S. drugmaker as Sovaldi, is transforming the liver-destroying viral disease by offering an effective cure, but Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and Medecins du Monde (MdM) said its high cost was a serious barrier. The campaigners argue that the patent on the drug is open to challenge because the science behind sofosbuvir is not new."
