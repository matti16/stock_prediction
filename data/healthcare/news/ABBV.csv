As Leerink's Geoffrey Porges and Bradley Canino write, California has returned to its activist approach in terms of drug prices this week, by passing SB-17, a new law that requires drug makers to give prior notification to payer and customers about drug price increases that are above a 16%, three-year cumulative threshold.  Well, the rules don't go into effect to 2019, so there is some breathing room. However, Porges and Canino think that it will help to pressure companies to keep prices down a bit, as it's part of a larger trend of scrutiny for drug prices that has been ongoing."

The trials tested a combination of veliparib with chemotherapy against chemo alone, and the results showed that the drug didn’t provide an added benefit.  From his note:  AbbVie’s PARP strategy was to test if its molecule could augment the benefit of chemotherapy, and while these data suggest there could be a lack of synergistic benefit with concomitant PARP therapy, a more likely explanation is that the inferior profile of veliparib compared to others in the PARP class undermined the drug’s prospects to achieve this synergy."
