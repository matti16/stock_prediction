As with past attacks across Europe, Islamic State has claimed responsibility, and there are signs he came into contact with a local Islamist suspected of being an IS recruiter. Amri is still nothing more than the main suspect but already, in political terms, it is hard to imagine a more troubling scenario for Angela Merkel to have to deal with."

More than 66 percent of Cosentyx patients achieved ""clear or almost clear"" skin after four years, Novartis said, comparable with the 68.5 percent who hit that milestone after one year. A durable response is important, since older biotech drugs for plaque psoriasis, known as anti-TNFs, can lose their effectiveness over time."
