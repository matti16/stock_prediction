Six months later, the UK Supreme Court rules from 9.30 am (0930 GMT) on whether PM Theresa May has the right to use a so-called ""royal prerogative"" to invoke the Article 50 exit clause or must go through parliament. Most observers expect it to follow the High Court's existing verdict that it should be the latter -- an outcome which need not prevent May from triggering Article 50 as planned by end-March given the expected majority for that in the House of Commons lower house."

The addition of LDR will bolster Zimmer Biomet's presence in the global Spine market and provide the Company with an immediate and a leading position in the fast growing cervical disc replacement (CDR) and MIS segments. The combination is expected to meaningfully accelerate the growth of Zimmer Biomet's Spine business through the incremental revenues associated with entry into the cervical disc replacement market and cross-portfolio selling opportunities to both Zimmer Biomet and LDR customer bases. Zimmer Biomet also expects the transaction to accelerate the future growth of its overall business. With respect to 2016, the Company reiterates its previously provided revenue guidance, an increase of 2.0% to 3.0% as compared to adjusted pro forma full year 2015 on a constant currency basis. The Company will update its revenue guidance to reflect this transaction at or about the time of closing. Zimmer Biomet is also reiterating its 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $7.85 - $8.00. The transaction is expected to be neutral to adjusted diluted EPS in 2017 and accretive thereafter."
