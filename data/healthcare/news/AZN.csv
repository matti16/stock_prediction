IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx is a Generation 2.5 antisense drug discovered by Ionis designed to directly target KRAS, one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer. KRAS mutations are thought to underlie the pathogenesis of up to 30% of human tumors. The KRAS protein is involved in regulating cell division and tumor cell survival. However, developing therapeutics using traditional drug modalities to block KRAS activity has proven difficult. IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx will be the first drug to enter clinical development that directly targets KRAS, regardless of mutation type. AstraZeneca will be responsible for further developing and commercializing IONIS-KRAS-2.5Rx."
